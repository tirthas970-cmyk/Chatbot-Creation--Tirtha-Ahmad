[2025-12-28 10:51:17] User requested info on topic: Climate Change with length 12.
[2025-12-28 10:51:19] Ai Assistant:/nPresent-day climate change includes both global warming—the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and its wider effects on Earth's climate system.
Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate.
The modern-day rise in global temperatures is driven by human activities, especially fossil fuel (coal, oil and natural gas) burning since the Industrial Revolution.
Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices release greenhouse gases.
These gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight, warming the lower atmosphere.
Earth's atmosphere now has roughly 50% more carbon dioxide, the main gas driving global warming, than it did at the end of the pre-industrial era, reaching levels not seen for millions of years.
Climate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment.
Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common.
Amplified warming in the Arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost, retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline.
Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes.

[2025-12-28 10:51:59] Ai Assistant:/nWorld War I, or the First World War (28 July 1914 – 11 November 1918), also known as the Great War, was a global conflict between two coalitions: the Allies (or Entente) and the Central Powers.
Major areas of conflict included Europe and the Middle East, as well as parts of Africa and the Asia-Pacific.
The war saw important developments in weaponry including tanks, aircraft, artillery, machine guns, and chemical weapons.
One of the deadliest conflicts in history, it resulted in an estimated 30 million military casualties, and 8 million civilian deaths from war-related causes and genocide.
The movement of large numbers of people was a major factor in the deadly Spanish flu pandemic.
The causes of World War I included the rise of the German Empire and decline of the Ottoman Empire, which disturbed the long-standing balance of power in Europe, the exacerbation of imperial rivalries, and an arms race between the great powers.
Growing tensions in the Balkans reached a breaking point on 28 June 1914 when Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb, assassinated Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne.
Austria-Hungary blamed Serbia, and declared war on 28 July.
After Russia mobilised in Serbia's defence, Germany declared war on Russia and France, who had an alliance.
The United Kingdom entered the war after Germany invaded Belgium, and the Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers in November.

[2025-12-28 17:16:37] Ai Assistant:/nBangladesh, officially the People's Republic of Bangladesh, is a country in South Asia.
It is the eighth-most populous country in the world and among the most densely populated with a population of over 171 million within an area of 148,460 square kilometres (57,320 sq mi).
Bangladesh shares land borders with India to the north, west, and east, and Myanmar to the southeast.
It has a coastline along the Bay of Bengal to its south and is separated from Bhutan and Nepal by the Siliguri Corridor, and from China by the Indian state of Sikkim to its north.
Dhaka, the capital and largest city, is the nation's political, financial, and cultural centre.
Chittagong is the second-largest city and the busiest port of the country.

The territory of modern Bangladesh was a stronghold of many Hindu and Buddhist dynasties in ancient history.
Following the Muslim conquest in 1204, the region saw Sultanate and Mughal rule.
During the Mughal period, particularly under the Bengal Subah, the region emerged as one of the most prosperous and commercially active parts of the world, known for its thriving textile industry and agricultural productivity.
The Battle of Plassey in 1757 marked the beginning of British colonial rule for the following two centuries.

[2025-12-28 17:20:36] Ai Assistant:/nJames Myers Thompson (September 27, 1906 – April 7, 1977) was an American novelist and screenwriter, known for his hardboiled crime fiction.
Thompson wrote more than thirty novels, the majority of which were original paperback publications, published from the late-1940s through mid-1950s.
Despite some positive critical notice—notably by Anthony Boucher in The New York Times—he was little-recognized in his lifetime.
Only after death did Thompson's literary stature grow.
In the late 1980s, several of his novels were re-published in the Black Lizard series of re-discovered crime fiction.
His best-regarded works include The Killer Inside Me, Savage Night, A Hell of a Woman and Pop.
1280.
In these works, Thompson turned the derided crime genre into literature and art, featuring unreliable narrators, odd structure, and the quasi-surrealistic inner narratives of the last thoughts of his dying or dead characters.
A number of Thompson's books were adapted as popular films, including The Getaway and The Grifters.
The writer Ronald Verlin Cassill has suggested that of all crime fiction, Thompson's was the rawest and most harrowing; that neither Dashiell Hammett nor Raymond Chandler nor Horace McCoy ever "wrote a book within miles of Thompson".

ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI, and released in November 2022.
It uses generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs), such as GPT-5, to generate text, speech, and images in response to user prompts.
It is credited with accelerating the AI boom, an ongoing period marked by rapid investment and public attention toward the field of artificial intelligence (AI).
OpenAI operates the service on a freemium model.
Users can interact with ChatGPT through text, audio, and image prompts.
The service gained 100 million users in two months, making it the fastest-growing consumer software application in history.
ChatGPT's website is among the top 5 most-visited websites globally.
It has been lauded for its potential to transform numerous professional fields, and instigated public debate about the nature of creativity and the future of knowledge work.
The chatbot has also been criticized for its limitations and potential for unethical use.
It can generate plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers, known as hallucinations.

[2025-12-29 10:49:25] Ai Assistant:
Present-day climate change includes both global warming—the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and its wider effects on Earth's climate system.
Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate.
The modern-day rise in global temperatures is driven by human activities, especially fossil fuel (coal, oil and natural gas) burning since the Industrial Revolution.
Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices release greenhouse gases.
These gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight, warming the lower atmosphere.
Earth's atmosphere now has roughly 50% more carbon dioxide, the main gas driving global warming, than it did at the end of the pre-industrial era, reaching levels not seen for millions of years.
Climate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment.
Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common.
Amplified warming in the Arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost, retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline.
Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes.
